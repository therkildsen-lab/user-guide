Welcome to the Therkildsen Lab repository for useful information regarding computational resources and guidelines. Feel free to navigate the site using the navigation pane on the left or use the Search bar to find a relevant topic. You can toggle light/dark modes using the tiny button at the bottm. 

Topics that should be addressed or changes needed to be made (aka "TODOs") can be logged via [GitHub Issues for this repository](https://github.com/therkildsen-lab/user-guide/issues). Please provide all the necessary information when submitting this way and, if possible, assign someone to the Issue. You can also directly make changes using the "Edit this page on GitHub" on the right panel of each page.

## How to add to these docs
The repository is setup to automagically build and deploy this website on `push` events to the repository, meaning all you need to do is write/modify files in the repo and the rest is taken care of. This site is built using the Hextra theme via Hugo, which enables special syntax to do nice things. It would be useful to read the [Hextra documentation](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/markdown/) to get a handle on how to use these great features to make the documentation more approachable.
