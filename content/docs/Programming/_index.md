Gone are the days of pressing a button and getting results-- bioinformatics requires programming at some level. Sometimes it's Bash,
sometimes it's R, sometimes it's something else. Either way, whatever it is you need to do, this section will be a decent starting point
to lower the barrier of entry for you. It's by no means comprehensive and not at all a substitute for taking the time to learn a langauge
outright, but it will present useful ideas and concepts to get you on your way. Take a deep breath, you got this.
