## How to add to these docs
The repository is setup to automagically build and deploy this website on `push` events to the repository, meaning all you need to do is write/modify files in the repo and the rest is taken care of. This site is built using the Hextra theme via Hugo, which enables special syntax to do nice things. It would be useful to read the [Hextra documentation](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/markdown/) to get a handle on how to use these great features to make the documentation more approachable.
